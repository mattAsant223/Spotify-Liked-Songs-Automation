# Spotify-Liked-Songs-Automation
Automation for placing your liked songs in a playlist that anyone can see!

This project was heavily inspired by the spotify-youtube automation I had previously done, but more indepth with spotify's api and interacting with both get and post request
be it user data or tracks from spotify. The main purpose of this software was to make retrieving tracks from your liked songs into a playlist automated which is an much easier process. Why would you want to do this? Main reason is allowing other spotify users to see your liked songs playlist, and to have the rest of the features that come with spotify playlist rather than just downloading tracks, which is the only function of the liked songs collection.

Hope you enjoy the program and making life using spotify easier!
